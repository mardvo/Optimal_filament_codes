This folder contains results from optimisation with C2 constraint. 

File Figure 7 takes optimal solutions for different volumes stored in rand_001_V.mat files, where V is the value of the volume, and makes Figure 7. 

File Figure 8 plots optimal solutions for an approximated shapes defined in r_pw_sqrt functions. The file takes pw_swrt_span_a1_V1.mat, which can be obtained by running pw_sqrt.m script.
